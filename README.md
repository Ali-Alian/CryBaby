# Starting the Babycry Project

The **Babycry** project focuses on detecting and analyzing baby crying sounds. By leveraging audio processing and machine learning, the system identifies different crying patterns and attempts to determine the underlying problem for each type of cry, such as hunger, discomfort, or sleepiness.

## Key Features

- **Cry Detection:** Recognizes when a baby is crying using sound analysis.
- **Pattern Analysis:** Differentiates between various crying patterns.
- **Problem Identification:** Suggests possible reasons for each cry (e.g., hunger, pain, tiredness).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the main application to start detecting and analyzing baby cries.
